# Overview
Hello, my name is Chris-Vital TAMPWO.
When I joined Orange as a work-study student, I discovered the DevOps culture for the very first time.
I was immediately fascinated by how this approach brings together development and operations teams around a shared goal — delivering faster, better, and together.
Since then, I’ve made DevOps the core of my professional journey.
My GitHub portfolio showcases this evolution through various projects where I’ve put DevOps principles into practice.
